# Q.How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Project Maintainability?? 

Typescript adds optional type annotations that get checked at compile time. While this might 
sound like extra work, the benefits are significant. 
1. Catch Errors Early 
TypeScript detects type mismatches before you even run your code. This early feedback loop helps 
prevent runtime errors that are harder to debug and fix later.  
2. Better IDE Support & Autocompletion 
Modern editors like VS Code leverage TypeScript's type information to provide intelligent code 
completion, inline documentation, and real-time feedback. This leads to faster development and 
fewer mistakes, especially in large codebases. 
3. Self-Documenting Code 
Types serve as documentation. When you define interfaces, enums, or function signatures with 
types, other developers (and your future self) can easily understand what a module expects and 
returns without reading through the implementation. 
4. Scalable Architecture 
TypeScript shines in large teams and complex projects. By enforcing strict typing and contracts 
between components, it encourages clear design patterns and modular architecture. 
Q.What is Type Inference in TypeScript—and Why is it 
Helpful? 
Type Inference is one of the most powerful features in TypeScript. It means it can automatically 
infer the type of a variable based on its initial value. 

# Q.Why is This Helpful? 
 Less Code, Same Safety: You get the benefits of type checking without the verbosity of 
manually writing out every type. 
 Smart Autocompletion: Inferred types power better IntelliSense in editors. 
 Cleaner Syntax: Especially useful for local variables and constants where the type is 
obvious.
